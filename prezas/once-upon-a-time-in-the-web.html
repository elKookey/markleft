<h2 id="the-world-wide-web">The world wide web!</h2>
<p>What is the world wide web? Basically it&#39;s a giant network of pages and resources identified and linked thanks to URLs. The Web is one application of the Internet. You should make the difference between the two, they&#39;re not the same. Internet existed long before. It was already used to do email, chat etc...</p>

<p class="list incremental">Let&#39;s see how it works. When you visit a regular web site it&#39;s a 2-step action. Your <strong>web browser</strong> sends an <strong>HTTP request</strong> through the <strong>Internet</strong> to a web server. The <strong>web server</strong> sends back an <strong>HTTP response</strong> to the web browser. This response is a <strong>web page</strong> and may contain <strong>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</strong>. Many other types of multimedia resources can be served. Let&#39;s how the web became was it is today!</p>

<h2 id="a-long-time-ago">A long time ago...</h2>

<p class="list incremental"><strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> <img src="../img/tbl.jpg" alt="Tim Berners-Lee"> while working at <strong>CERN</strong> invented the <strong>World Wide Web</strong> around <strong>1990</strong>. The Internet was already here but not from much. He created the HyperText Transfer Protocol (<strong>HTTP</strong>), the HyperText Markup Language (<strong>HTML</strong>), the <strong>first web browser</strong> (WorldWideWeb) and the <strong>first web server</strong> (CERN HTTPd) using a NeXTcube computer. His colleague Robert Cailliau helped him during this historical period.</p>

<h3>Mosaic</h3>

<p class="list incremental"><img src="../img/mosaic.png" alt="Mosaic logo">
Released in <strong>1993</strong>, Mosaic was <strong>one of the first popular</strong> web browser for general public thanks to its clean graphical user interface. It was originally designed and programmed by <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong> and <strong>Eric Bina</strong> for National Center for Supercomputing Applications (<strong>NCSA</strong>). First version supported Unix&#39;s X Window System. Windows and Macintosh ports came just after.</p>

<h3>Netscape navigator</h3>

<p class="list incremental"><img src="../img/netscape.png" alt="Netscape navigator logo">
<strong>Marc Andreessen</strong> then co-created Mosaic Communications which was quickly renamed <strong>Netscape Communications</strong> for legal issues. The company released the first version of Netscape navigator in late <strong>1994</strong>. Even if Marc developed Mosaic, Netscape was developped <strong>from scratch</strong>. Internal name of Netscape navigator was <strong>Mozilla : &quot;Mozaic Killer&quot;</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="w3c">W3C</h2>

<p class="list incremental"><img src="../img/w3c.png" alt="W3C logo">
It&#39;s a <strong>standard organization</strong> founded by <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> in <strong>1994</strong> after he left the CERN. It was created to ensure long term growth of the Web and its standards. W3C currently manages specifications for <strong>HTML, XHTML</strong>, <strong>XML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>PNG, SVG</strong>...</p>

<h2 id="css">CSS</h2>

<p class="list incremental">At the time, web presentation possibilities were thin. The idea to <strong>separate structure from presentation</strong> was a need. In the end of 1994, <strong>nine stylesheet languages</strong> were proposed to the <strong>W3C mailing list</strong>. <strong>Two were chosen</strong> as the foundation of what would become CSS. <strong>Håkon Wium Lie</strong> <img src="../img/wium-lie.jpg" alt="Håkon Wium Lie"> who currently works for Opera Software proposed CHSS and <strong>Bert Bos</strong> proposed Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal (SSP). The two worked together and by the end of <strong>1996</strong>, CSS was ready to become official.</p>

<h2 id="javascript">JavaScript</h2>

<p class="list incremental">In <strong>1995</strong>, <strong>Brendan Eich</strong> <img src="../img/eich.jpg" alt="Brendan Eich"> developped the language for <strong>Netscape Communications</strong>. The project name changed twice : <strong>Mocha then LiveScript</strong> and then JavaScript (because of Sun Microsystems partnership with Netscape). JavaScript is <strong>not related to Java!</strong>In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to <strong>Ecma International</strong>, a standard organization. Work resulted in the standardized version named <strong>ECMAScript</strong>.</p>

<h3>Internet explorer</h3>

<p class="list incremental"><img src="../img/ie.png" alt="Internet Explorer logo">
In 1994, <strong>Microsoft</strong> aquired NCSA <strong>Mosaic source code</strong> (property of Spyglass). They modified it, renamed it to Internet Explorer and released it in august <strong>1995</strong>. Thanks to windows market share IE won the first browser war and reached <strong>95% of users in 2002</strong>. They developped their own rendering engine known as <strong>Trident</strong> and the latest version of the javascript engine is called <strong>Chakra</strong>.</p>

<p class="list incremental">Microsoft invented the <strong>iframe in 1997</strong>. Use it carefully.</p>

<p class="list incremental">As part of Outlook Web Access, Microsoft originally created the <strong>XMLHttpRequest in 2000</strong>, needed for every AJAX call.</p>

<h3>Opera</h3>

<p class="list incremental"><img src="../img/opera.png" alt="Opera logo">
In <strong>1996</strong>, <strong>Opera software</strong> released the first public version (2.0) of Opera. Opera is known for its <strong>focus on standards</strong>. Their rendering engine <strong>Presto</strong> and their javascript engine <strong>Carakan</strong> are home made and proprietary. It suffered from an <strong>add banner until 2005</strong>. Opera never had a big market share on desktops but was one of the early actors on <strong>mobile phones</strong>, before the smartphone apps era. It is more of an <strong>internet tool suite</strong>, it includes an email client, a BitTorrent client, an IRC client...</p>

<h3>Safari</h3>

<p class="list incremental"><img src="../img/safari.png" alt="Safari logo">
On January <strong>2003</strong>, <strong>Apple</strong> announced Safari 1. It <strong>uses WebKit</strong> the rendering engine of KHTML. Their JavaScript engine is called <strong>Nitro</strong>. In 2007, the company made a mobile version of their own browser for the <strong>iPhone platform</strong>. Safari desktop doesn&#39;t have a huge market share. Even if they released a <strong>windows version in 2007</strong>, they rely on the mac population.</p>

<h3>Firefox</h3>

<p class="list incremental"><img src="../img/firefox.png" alt="Firefox logo">
In 2003, the netscape-affiliated Mozilla Organization founded the <strong>Mozilla Foundation</strong>. They released the first version of Firefox in <strong>2004</strong>. Firefox was first meant to be called <strong>Phoenix and then Firebird</strong> but other companies owned thoses names. Firefox was simply a safe, unique and cool-sounding option. The rendering engine is called <strong>Gecko</strong> and was developped way before the mozilla adventure. The JavaScript engine <strong>SpiderMonkey</strong> is actually the first one written by Brendan Eich himself. It has been updated since. Firefox is probably the more famous <strong>open-source</strong> application out there.</p>

<p class="list incremental">Firefox owns the most downloaded app record (more than <strong>8 million in 24 hours</strong>) for Firefox 3.</p>

<h3>Chrome</h3>

<p class="list incremental"><img src="../img/chrome.png" alt="Chrome logo">
In September <strong>2008</strong>, <strong>Google</strong> released Chrome for Windows. <strong>In 2010, Linux and MacOS</strong> were released as stable versions. Google <strong>uses WebKit</strong> rendering engine. They tried to reassure web developers that if it worked on Safari it would work on Chrome. Their major arguments are speed with their <strong>V8</strong> JavaScript engine and a <strong>minimalistic UI</strong>. The project is based on the <strong>open source</strong> chromium project they created at the same time.</p>
